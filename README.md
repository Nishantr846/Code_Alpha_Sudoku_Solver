# Sudoku Solver with User Input
This repository contains a C++ implementation of a Sudoku solver using the backtracking algorithm. Sudoku is a popular number puzzle game that requires filling a 9x9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids that compose the grid contain all of the digits from 1 to 9. The program allows users to input an incomplete Sudoku puzzle, represented as a 2D array, and solves it using backtracking.

## Follow the prompts to use the code to solve a sudoku:
### Clone the Repository
### Compile the Code
### Run the Program
### Enter Sudoku Puzzle:
    The program will prompt you to enter the dimension of the Sudoku puzzle (e.g., 4, 6, 9).
    Next, input the Sudoku puzzle, using '0' to represent empty cells.

### View Solution:
    If a solution exists, the program will print the solved Sudoku grid.
    If no solution exists, it will display a message indicating that.
